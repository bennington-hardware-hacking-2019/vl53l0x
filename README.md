# vl53l0x

VL53L0X API is written by STMicroelectronics in C language and
made available online at [ST](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/stsw-img005.html).
Instead of wrapping the API so that it can be used in Python, this package
attempts to port the C logic into Python one and provide a nice set of native
Python API functions.
